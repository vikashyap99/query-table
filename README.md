# Query table

# Ideation 

Features to Help Data Analysts:

Favorites or Bookmarks: Allowing users to save frequently used or important queries as favorites or bookmarks can streamline their workflow.
Query History: A feature to maintain a history of executed queries can help data analysts refer back to previous analyses and results.
Data Visualization: Integrating data visualization tools or charts can make it easier for data analysts to interpret and communicate their findings effectively.

# Design
This rough layout showcases the search input field, predefined query buttons, an execute button to trigger queries, the table with column headers and data, and pagination controls at the bottom for easy navigation. The focus is on making the application's essential features readily accessible to the user while maintaining a clear and logical flow.

# Implementation

The code creates a functional React application with a table that displays data based on user-selected predefined queries or random search. The Inputs component likely contains the JSX code you provided earlier, which would include a <Select> element with predefined queries and an input field for manual queries. The behavior is driven by the state variables data and query, which are updated in response to user interactions and trigger re-renders of the table. This code snippet defines a React functional component called Pagination. which control the number of items displayed per page and the current page's starting index, respectively.

 Here's a step-by-step explanation of its implementation:

  1.  Predefined Queries: A list called Querys is defined, containing three objects with predefined queries. Each object has an id, a query string representing the SQL query, an offset, and a limit to be used for slicing the tableData later.
  
  
  2. State: Two state variables are declared using the useState hook. data represents the current data to be displayed in the table, initialized with the tableData. query represents the selected query, initially an empty string.
  
  
  3. Handlers: Two functions are defined: searchHandler and selectHandler. searchHandler generates random offset and limit values, then updates the data state with a new sliced array from the tableData. It also resets the query state to an empty string. selectHandler updates the query state with the selected query, and then retrieves the corresponding offset and limit from the Querys array to update the data state accordingly.
  
  
  4. Rendering Functions: Two functions are defined to render the table content and header. The renderContent function maps over the data array and generates rows and cells for the table. The renderHeader function maps over the keys of the first element in data to generate table headers with capitalized column names.
  
  
  5. Components: The main App component returns JSX elements. It includes the custom Inputs component, passing the searchHandler, selectHandler, Querys, and query as props. It also renders the table, displaying the headers and the content generated by the renderHeader and renderContent functions.
  
  
  6. Pagination:  The Pagination component can be used in conjunction with other components that display a subset of the data array based on the limit and offset values. By using the leftHandler and rightHandler functions to update the offset, you can navigate through different pages of the dataset. This enables pagination functionality, making it easier to handle large datasets and improve user experience by displaying data in manageable chunks.

# Optimization 

By using pagination, the application divides the dataset into manageable chunks, enhancing user experience and making it easier for data analysts to navigate through large datasets. This prevents overwhelming the user with too much data on a single page, leading to faster rendering times and a smoother user interface.

To further optimize the rendering performance, the useMemo hook is used to memoize the results of the renderContent and renderHeader functions. Memoization stores the result of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the inputs to the function have not changed. In this case, the visualData array serves as the input for the renderContent and renderHeader functions. By memoizing these functions with useMemo, unnecessary re-rendering of the table content and header is prevented when other parts of the component update.
